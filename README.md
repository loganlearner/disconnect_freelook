# Disconect Freelook

## What this does!
This addon gives users the ability to noclip throughout the map when they or the server loses connection. Potential uses for this could be to help your users find the source of lag be it a prop spammer or other... It's recommended that you use this in the sandbox gamemode due to players having the ability to peep at other players entities for example DarkRP money printers.
